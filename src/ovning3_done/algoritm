PROBLEM:
Find the path and stations which results
in the shortest distance travllet.
 
FÖRVILLKOR:

There is four zones; Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4.

The number of stations in the zone are;
1, (1 < i < m), (1 < j < m), 1.

Distance from X to Z1: ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m) - in a array
Distance from Z1 to Z2: bij (1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n) - in a array
Distance from Z2 to Z3: cj (1 ≤ j ≤ n) - in a array

The paths between Z2 and Z3 go from every 
station in Z2 to every station in Z3.

The paths between X to Z1 go from every
station in Z1 to X but not vice versa.

The paths between Y to Z3 go from every
station in Z3 to Y but not vice versa.

EFTERVILLKOR :

Return the stations to go through
& the distance of the shortest path.

ALGORITHM - BESKRIVNING:

1. Add the distances from X to station n to
	the path between station n to (n, m).

2. Add the distances from Y to station m to
	the path between station m to (n, m)
 
3. Repeat for all stations (n * m)
 
4. Use a sort algoritm to find the shortest distance
