PROBLEM (SUBTRACTION)
Calculate subtraction on the integers as
strings and return the result.

Algoritm:
 1. Look at the first char at both strings.
 2. Interpret the chars as integers
 3. Repeat the same process for the next char for
 the lenght of the longest of the two strings.
 
FÃ–RVILLKOR 
Input two integers as strings.

EFTERVILLKOR 
Output one integer as a string.

ALGORITHM - BESKRIVNING
